    <ul>
        
        <li>4 hot dog wieners</li>
        <li>4 hotdog or sausage buns</li>
        <li>4 pickles, sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 cup beef chili, warmed</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded sharp Canadian cheddar</li>
        <li>ketchup, prepared mustard and relish for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the hot dogs: Preheat grill to 500°F. Using a pairing knife, cut small 45° slits along the length of the wieners, marking every half-inch and going about halfway deep. Transfer the wieners onto the hot grill and cook for about 5 minutes, turning occasionally to ensure they’re uniformly cooked. Use wieners in one or more of the following ways:</li>
        <li>Open buns on work surface and line each side with pickle slices. Place one cooked wiener onto each bun. Add a helping of chili on top of each, spreading it across the hot dog. Sprinkle with cheese. Place prepared hot dogs into an oven-safe casserole or rectangular baking pan. Transfer to preheated 250°F oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese has melted and bun is toasted. Garnish with ketchup, mustard and relish. Serve immediately</li>
